Issues
------

If you run into any problems or have ideas for features (even if you
can't personally implement them!), please open an issue on GitHub. Bug
reporting and feature design is a great way to get involved with this
project.

Dependencies
------------

Weasel currently vendors all known dependencies. It's possible that
this may change in the future, but unless there is a compelling reason,
any new dependencies should also be appropriately vendored.
